# Project Title
Mind in Motion: A “Learning How to Learn” Toolkit Website

# Purpose
This site distills the most actionable insights from Learning How to Learn into a shareable resource I will use to guide my own study sessions ﹘ and to help classmates, colleagues, and family adopt brain-based learning strategies.

# Course Topics Addressed

- Focused vs. Diffuse Thinking
- Procrastination & Habit Loops
- Memory Systems, Chunking, Spaced Repetition
- Deliberate Practice, Interleaving & Overlearning
- Meta-Learning & Illusions of Competence
- Neuromodulators (Dopamine, ACh, Serotonin, Cortisol) and Motivation

# Citation Note
This project synthesizes ideas from the LHTL MOOC, plus research articles listed in the “References” section of the site. Direct quotations are avoided; therefore inline citations are not included.

# How It Can Be Used
- Students can skim sections before study blocks or take the built-in quiz to reinforce key concepts.
- Teachers/Parents can link or embed specific sections (e.g., Habit Loop graphic) in lesson plans.
- Self-learners can host their own fork on GitHub Pages and adapt the tips to their workflow.

# Optional Extras for Reviewers
- Try the self-check quiz at the bottom to test your recall.
